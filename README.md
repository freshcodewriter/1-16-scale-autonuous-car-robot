# 1-16-scale-autonuous-car-robot
Build a robot car with autonomous function from scratch, which means we designed the mechanical parts, electrical circuit and wrote software code by ourselves. 
Several videos clips, both in the competition and outside the competition, are included in this section to demonstrate the functionality of our robot. Each video provides youtube link and google drive link.
